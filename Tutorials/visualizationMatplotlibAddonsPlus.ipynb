    "## Visualization with Seaborn\n",
    "Matplotlib has proven to be an incredibly useful and popular visualization tool, but even avid users will admit it often leaves much to be desired. There are several valid complaints about Matplotlib that often come up:\n",
    "- Prior to version 2.0, Matplotlib's defaults are not exactly the best choices. It was based off of MATLAB circa 1999, and this often shows.\n",
    "- Matplotlib's API is relatively low level. Doing sophisticated statistical visualization is possible, but often requires a lot of boilerplate code.\n",
    "- Matplotlib predated Pandas by more than a decade, and thus is not designed for use with Pandas ```DataFrames```. In order to visualize data from a Pandas ```DataFrame```, you must extract each Series and often concatenate them together into the right format. It would be nicer to have a plotting library that can intelligently use the ```DataFrame``` labels in a plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "An answer to these problems is [Seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/). Seaborn provides an API on top of Matplotlib that offers sane choices for plot style and color defaults, defines simple high-level functions for common statistical plot types, and integrates with the functionality provided by Pandas ```DataFrames```."
