    "## Visualizing Errors\n",
    "For any scientific measurement, accurate accounting for errors is nearly as important, if not more important, than accurate reporting of the number itself. For example, imagine that you am using some astrophysical observations to estimate the Hubble Constant, the local measurement of the expansion rate of the Universe. You know that the current literature suggests a value of around 71 (km/s)/Mpc, and you measure a value of 74 (km/s)/Mpc with your method. Are the values consistent? The only correct answer, given this information, is this: there is no way to know.\n",

Unfortunately, it also means that these sorts of features often must be manually tweaked, a process that can be very time consuming when producing publication-quality graphics! Finally, I'll note that the preceding mix of styles is by no means best practice for presenting data, but rather included as a demonstration of some of the available options."
